This is just a collection of commands I find myself looking up again and again. Hopefully by putting them here, they'll sink in :)

{% highlight bash %}
git remote set-url origin /vagrant
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<username>/<repo>.git
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight bash %}
git checkout --track origin/<other-branch-name>
{% endhighlight %}
